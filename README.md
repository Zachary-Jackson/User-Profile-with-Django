# User-Profile-with-Django
This is a Django application that allows a user to create a user profile with information such as the user's name, bio, avatar and more. The user can also change passwords provided it meets certain criteria. The goal for this project is to hook up all of the behind the scenes logic that makes this site run. This User Profile website was built in part with HTML and CSS originally supplied from www.teamtreehouse.com for a Python Web Development Tech Degree Project. The HTML and CSS is to be considered built by teamtreehouse for this project(Everything included in the second git-hub repo except for the license, readme.md, and requirments.txt were built by teamtreehouse), but may be edited by me at some point. The same goes for much of the accounts, assets, extra_credit_image_editor, and project_7 folder shells.
